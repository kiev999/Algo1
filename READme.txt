Sentence Analysis Algorithm
This repository contains an algorithm that analyzes a sentence by counting its length, the number of words, and the number of vowels. The algorithm takes a sentence as input, character by character, and calculates the length by incrementing a counter for each character. It also counts the number of words by detecting spaces and increments a word counter accordingly. Additionally, it identifies vowels in the sentence and increments a vowel counter. The algorithm is implemented in [programming language], and it follows the specified evaluation criteria of using three variables as counters.
